# Vision Transformer (ViT) for MNIST Classification

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The project compares the performance of the transformer-based model with a traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of using transformers for image classification tasks.

Additionally, this repository includes a detailed write-up that explains the methodology, model training process, evaluation, and results.

## Usage

### Train the ViT Model

Run the Jupyter Notebook provided (VIT.ipynb) to train the Vision Transformer model on the MNIST dataset. It includes:

* Dataset preprocessing.

* Model initialization and training setup.

* Accuracy and loss visualization.

* Model evaluation with a confusion matrix.

### Compare with CNN Model

### Read the Write-up

The repository includes a PDF file containing a detailed discussion on the methodology, model performance comparison, and insights into the strengths and weaknesses of ViT and CNN models.

## Results

| Model | Training Loss (Final) | Validation Loss (Final) | Accuracy
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ViT | 0.18 | 0.18 | 95.0% |
| CNN | 0.16 | 0.08 | 97.3% |

Key Takeaways

CNN outperforms ViT in this specific MNIST classification task in terms of accuracy and loss.

ViT requires more computational resources and is less efficient compared to CNN for small datasets like MNIST.

ViT models capture global relationships well, but CNNs remain superior for localized pattern recognition tasks like handwritten digit classification.

Potential Improvements

Implement data augmentation to improve generalization.

Fine-tune transformer hyperparameters for better accuracy.

Experiment with alternative ViT architectures (e.g., Swin Transformer, DeiT).

Explore other datasets where transformers might perform better than CNNs.
